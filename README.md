# Git 101
test

**git add [filename]** Adds a file to the staging area  
  **git commit -m "commit message"** Commits (saves) all changes in staging  
**git push origin [branch]** Pushes (uploads) all commits to gitlab  
**git pull origin [branch]** Pulls (downloads) commits from gitlab. Remember to do this before you start writing code  
**git checkout [branch]** Switches to a different branch  
**git checkout -b [branch]** Creates a new branch and switches to it  
**git merge [branch]** Merges two branches (be careful here. I can do merging if you're unsure)  

Always work in feature branch, not in master or dev.  
Commit messages (as well as code) should be written in English. Commit messages must be written in imperative tense, i.e. *git commit -m "Implement login authentication"* and **not** *git commit -m "Implemented login authentication"*
